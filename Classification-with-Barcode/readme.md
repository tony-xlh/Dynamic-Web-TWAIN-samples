## Scan Documents and Classify


A web demo scans documents using [Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/overview/) and classify the documents based on barcodes read by [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/overview/).

### How the Documents Are Classified

Here is a [sample PDF](https://github.com/tony-xlh/Dynamic-Web-TWAIN-samples/releases/download/assets/forms-with-barcodes.pdf).

There are two forms in the PDF. Each form contains several pages and on the first page, there is a barcode denoting the form number. The documents are classified using the barcodes.
